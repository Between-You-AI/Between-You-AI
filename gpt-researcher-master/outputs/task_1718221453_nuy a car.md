This report aims to provide a detailed, insightful, and comprehensive guide to buying a car in 2024, leveraging the latest data and expert opinions from various reputable sources.

## Market Trends in 2024

### New Car Market

In 2024, the new car market is experiencing a rare period of stability. Although prices remain close to record highs, they have stabilized after several years of tumultuous changes driven by the pandemic and subsequent supply chain shortages. The average transaction price for new cars is $47,433, which is down 0.2% year-over-year but up 0.5% since last month ([CarEdge](https://caredge.com/guides/new-car-price-trends-in-2024)).

### Used Car Market

The used car market in 2024 tells a different story. Used car prices are falling due to compelling new car incentives and high interest rates, which have slowed used car sales. The average used car listing price is $25,571. So far in 2024, there have been 15 weeks of dropping prices and 8 weeks of rising prices ([CarEdge](https://caredge.com/guides/used-car-price-trends-for-2024)).

### Incentives and Financing

The summer of 2024 is packed with low-APR deals for new car buyers. With high inventory levels for some car brands, incentives are here to stay, making it a good time to buy a new car. OEMs are offering more and better financing incentives, including near or at zero percent APR and generous cash incentives ([CarEdge](https://caredge.com/guides/summer-2024-car-market-update)).
